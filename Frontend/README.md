## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The frontend follows a modern, component-driven modular structure:

```text
Frontend/
├── public/                 # Static assets, logos, and favicons
├── src/
│   ├── components/         # Shared and modular UI components
│   │   ├── LandingPage/    # Main marketing page segments (Hero, Navbar, Footer, FAQ, CTA)
│   │   ├── coding/         # DSA-specific widgets (Analytics, CodeEditor, ReportDrawers)
│   │   └── layout/         # Application shell wrapper components (Sidebar, TopNavbar)
│   ├── constants/          # Application configs, constants, navigation lists
│   ├── contexts/           # Context APIs for global states
│   ├── pages/              # Main route views
│   ├── services/           # Interceptors and API service calls
│   ├── utils/              # Client-side helpers (PDF generators)
│   ├── App.jsx             # Main routing shell
│   └── main.jsx            # Entry mount point
├── index.html              # HTML shell template

## 🚦 Routing Structure

Client-side navigation is managed declaratively using `react-router-dom`:

- `/` - Public Landing Page (Navbar, Hero, FAQ, CTA sections)
- `/login` - Sign In console
- `/signup` - Student registration page
- `/oauth-success` - Callback handler for Google OAuth redirect
- `/dashboard` - Private Student Workspace
- `/aptitude-practice` - Quantitative/Logical reasoning practice launcher
- `/aptitude/history` - Historical scores and metrics
- `/aptitude/report/:attemptId` - In-depth quiz diagnostic review
- `/resume-analyzer` - Resume scanner and advice engine
- `/resume/history` - Historical ATS uploads log
- `/mock-interview` - AI Mock Interview workspace
- `/coding-journey` - DSA tracker and code sandbox
- `/interview-experiences` - Placement experience sharing directory
- `/settings` - Theme customization, account updates, connected platforms configs

## 💾 State Management

- **Global Auth State (`AuthContext`)**: Global state manager handling user details, JWT storage initialization on startup, session token verification, registration inputs validation, and secure session clearing.
- **Local Page States**: Utilizes React hooks (`useState`, `useRef`, `useCallback`, `useMemo`) for component-scoped rendering (e.g., chat message arrays, editor solution code buffers, search filter queries, and active animation timers).
